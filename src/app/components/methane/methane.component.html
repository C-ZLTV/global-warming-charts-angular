    <p>Methane is a flammable gas formed by geological and biological processes. Some of the natural ones are leaks from natural gas systems and wetlands.</p>

    <p>50-65% of total global methane emissions come from human activities. These include livestock, agriculture, oil and gas systems, waste from homes and businesses, landfills, and so on.</p>

    <p>Methane is a gas with a global warming potential several times stronger than of CO2. For more than 650,000 years, methane concentration in the atmosphere was between 350 â€“ 800 ppb. From the beginning of the industrial revolution, human activities have increased this amount by around 150%.</p>
